# 🐾 Image Classification of Animals

## 📌 Objective

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately *identify animals in images*. It uses a dataset containing labeled images of 15 animal classes and applies deep learning techniques to classify them.

---

## 🐘 Dataset

The dataset consists of 15 folders, each representing a distinct animal class. Each image has dimensions of *224 x 224 x 3*, making it suitable for image classification models such as CNNs.

### 📂 Classes in the dataset:
- Bear
- Bird
- Cat
- Cow
- Deer
- Dog
- Dolphin
- Elephant
- Giraffe
- Horse
- Kangaroo
- Lion
- Panda
- Tiger
- Zebra

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch 
- OpenCV / PIL for image preprocessing
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

---

## 🚀 Model Architecture

The model explores the use of:
- *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)*
- *Transfer Learning* using pre-trained models like *VGG16, **ResNet50, or **MobileNet* for improved accuracy and efficiency.

## 📈 Results

Model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
